# Features

EngCode includes a variety of features that make it a versatile and powerful programming language.

## Overview

- Functions
- Classes
- Standard Library

### Functions

Functions in EngCode allow you to create reusable blocks of code. You can define functions with parameters and call them with arguments.

#### Function Definition

A function definition in EngCode looks like this:

```engcode
define a function named 'greet' that takes parameters 'name'
print('Hello, ' + name)
end function
```

#### Function Call

To call a function, use the `call the function` statement:

```engcode
call the function 'greet' with arguments ('Alice')
```

### Classes

EngCode supports object-oriented programming through classes. You can define classes, create objects, and define methods within classes.

#### Class Definition

A class definition in EngCode looks like this:

```engcode
define a class named 'Person'
create a variable named 'first_name' with value 'Unknown'
create a variable named 'last_name' with value 'Unknown'
define a method named 'full_name' that takes parameters 'self'
self_return = self['first_name'] + ' ' + self['last_name']
return self_return
end method
end class
```

#### Object Creation

To create an object of a class, use the `create an object named` statement:

```engcode
create an object named 'person1' of class 'Person'
person1.first_name = 'John'
person1.last_name = 'Doe'
print(person1.full_name())
```

### Standard Library

EngCode includes a standard library with functions for mathematical and string operations.

#### Mathematical Functions

EngCode provides several built-in functions for common mathematical operations.

##### Square Root

```engcode
create a variable named 'math_lib' with value import('math')
print('Square Root of 16: ' + str(math_lib['sqrt'](16)))
```

##### Power

```engcode
print('2 to the power of 3: ' + str(math_lib['pow'](2, 3)))
```

#### String Manipulation Functions

EngCode also includes functions for manipulating strings.

##### Uppercase Conversion

```engcode
create a variable named 'str_lib' with value import('str')
print('Upper Case: ' + str_lib['upper']('hello'))
```

##### Replace

```engcode
print('Replace o with a: ' + str_lib['replace']('hello', 'o', 'a'))
```

EngCode’s features make it a powerful and flexible language for a variety of programming tasks. Whether you’re writing a simple script or a complex application, EngCode has the tools you need to get the job done.

# Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while using EngCode.

## Common Issues

### Syntax Error

**Problem**: You encounter a syntax error when running your EngCode script.

**Solution**: Double-check your EngCode statements to ensure they are correctly formatted. EngCode syntax closely resembles natural English, but it’s important to follow the specific syntax rules outlined in the documentation. Ensure that keywords are spelled correctly and that the structure of your statements is correct.

### Undefined Variable

**Problem**: You get an error saying that a variable is undefined.

**Solution**: Ensure all variables are declared before use. In EngCode, you declare variables using the `create a variable named` statement. Make sure you have a line that declares the variable before you try to use it in your code.

```engcode
create a variable named 'age' with value 25
print('Age: ' + str(age))
```

### TypeError

**Problem**: You encounter a `TypeError` when performing operations on variables.

**Solution**: Ensure that the operations you are performing are valid for the types of variables you are using. For example, trying to add a string and an integer will result in a `TypeError`. Use type conversion functions like `str()` and `int()` to ensure variables are of the correct type for the operation.

```engcode
create a variable named 'age' with value 25
print('Age: ' + str(age))  # Convert integer to string before concatenation
```

## Error Messages

### Unexpected EOF

**Problem**: You encounter an `Unexpected EOF` error.

**Solution**: Ensure all blocks of code are properly closed. For example, if you start a loop or a function definition, make sure you have the corresponding `end while` or `end function` statement.

```engcode
create a variable named 'counter' with value 0
while the variable 'counter' is less than 3
print('Counter: ' + str(counter))
counter = counter + 1
end while
```

### NameError

**Problem**: You encounter a `NameError` when trying to use a function or variable.

**Solution**: Ensure that the function or variable has been defined before it is used. Functions must be defined before they are called, and variables must be declared before they are referenced.

```engcode
define a function named 'greet' that takes parameters 'name'
print('Hello, ' + name)
end function

call the function 'greet' with arguments ('Alice')
```

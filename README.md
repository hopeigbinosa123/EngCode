- **Creative Coding**: Artists and creators can experiment with EngCode to create interactive art and multimedia projects.


## Usage

Run an EngCode script using the interpreter provided in the repository:

```sh
python engcode_interpreter.py example.engcode
```

## Examples

Here are some examples to get you started. You can find more examples in the `examples` directory.

### Basic Example

```engcode
create a variable named 'name' with value 'Alice'
create a variable named 'age' with value 25
print('Name: ' + name)
print('Age: ' + str(age))
if the variable 'age' is greater than 18
print('You are an adult')
else
print('You are a minor')
```

### Function and Class Example

```engcode
# Define a function
define a function named 'greet' that takes parameters 'name'
print('Hello, ' + name)
end function

# Call the function
call the function 'greet' with arguments ('Alice')

# Define a class
define a class named 'Person'
create a variable named 'first_name' with value 'Unknown'
create a variable named 'last_name' with value 'Unknown'
define a method named 'full_name' that takes parameters 'self'
self_return = self['first_name'] + ' ' + self['last_name']
return self_return
end method
end class

# Create an object of the class
create an object named 'person1' of class 'Person'
person1.first_name = 'John'
person1.last_name = 'Doe'

# Print object attributes and call the method
print(person1.first_name + ' ' + person1.last_name)
print(person1.full_name())
```
